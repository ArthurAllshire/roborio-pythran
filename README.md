# roborio-pythran
Build code for the roborio using Pythran.

This repository is based off the robotpy project's [roborio-opencv](https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-opencv) repository.

To run this, install docker and run `./launch.sh`. Then `./configure.sh` and `./build.sh`.
At the moment, place the `estimator_pythran.py` and `.pythran` files in `src/` in this directory.
